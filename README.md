## 📝 About the Project

**LocalConnect** is a centralized, user-friendly solution where users can find, book, and securely pay for various local services (electricians, plumbers, tutors, etc.). 

Unlike existing urban-centric platforms, LocalConnect focuses on **semi-urban and rural areas**. It aims to empower local small businesses and provide communities with a dependable service ecosystem by addressing critical issues like digital literacy, trust barriers, and opportunities for freshers.

## ❓ Problem Statement

Many communities struggle with:
* **Disconnect:** Residents cannot find reliable local help, and skilled workers struggle to reach customers.
* **Trust Issues:** Lack of verification leads to safety concerns and inconsistent service quality.
* **Digital Barriers:** Existing platforms are often too complex for digitally illiterate workers in rural areas.
* **Barriers for Freshers:** New workers lack visibility and mentorship opportunities.

### 2. 🤝 Collaborative Mentorship Model

### 4. 💰 Advanced Dynamic Pricing
